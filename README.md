# Eliana [![Build Status]

Project codename Eliana. Pre-release of Pictomood. Archived repo.

## Why Eliana?

Just a beautiful random name for our engine. The name itself derives from Hebrew, meaning *"My God has answered me."* Thinking of a name is something that drains your brain out, and yes, God has answered our plea for a beautiful name.
